# Mokshitha's Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The portfolio is a reflection of how I think about engineering and product: strong fundamentals, clear systems thinking, and purposeful execution. It highlights my work, experience, and interests across software development, product thinking, and systems design.

## About Me

I’m a pre-final year student at IIT (BHU) with a strong foundation in operating systems, computer networks, and large-scale system behavior. I care deeply about performance, scalability, and reliability, and I reason about these aspects before writing code.

Beyond engineering, I think deeply about product: what to build, why it matters, and how to ship it well. I take ownership of my work and actively contribute to open source, because the best way to learn is to build in the open.
